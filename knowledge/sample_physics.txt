Physics Fundamentals

Newton's Laws of Motion:
1. An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an external force.
2. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass (F = ma).
3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

Thermodynamics:
- First Law: Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted.
- Second Law: The entropy of an isolated system always increases over time.
- Third Law: As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system approaches a constant minimum.

Quantum Mechanics:
- Wave-particle duality: Particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
- Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: It is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle.
- Schrödinger Equation: Describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time.
